First, run PatternsFinder.java to generate all the triple patterns out of train queries.
Next, run FindPredicates.java to extract the predicates from of each triple pattern.
Next, run WeightGeneratorFromTestQueries.java to draw weighted graph out of the predicates based on their co-occurances.
Finally, run PartitionGenerator.java to obtain final partitions.
